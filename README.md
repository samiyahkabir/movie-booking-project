🎟️ Movie Ticket Booking System

A command-line based Movie Ticket Booking System developed in Java that allows users to register, log in with secure credentials, and reserve seats in their chosen auditorium. Designed with both user and admin functionality, this project demonstrates object-oriented programming, hashing techniques for user authentication, and exception handling.

🧩 Key Features

👥 User Features
Secure Login & Registration:
Users create unique accounts using a username-password combination, stored using a hashtable-based system.
Auditorium Selection:
Choose from multiple auditoriums showing different movies.
Interactive Seat Booking:
Visual representation of seat availability with the ability to select or modify seat reservations.
Order Management:
View, edit, or cancel existing ticket orders.
🔐 Admin Features
Admin Menu:
Separate admin login to manage the system with elevated privileges.
View Sales Reports:
Access booking statistics and seat availability across all auditoriums.
User Management:
Review registered user activity and bookings.
🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Java
Data Structures: Hashtable (for storing user credentials and handling logins)
Concepts Practiced:
Hashing for authentication
Exception handling for input validation and edge cases
File I/O (if applicable to save user or booking data)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
